# infinisweeper

An online, globally multiplayer minesweeper. Play with your friends and compete from the longest run!

- HTML - login/profile/settings pages
- CSS - making a cohesive and clean style for the site
- JS - all the logic for the minesweeper
- Authentication - letting users log in so they can store their all time progress
- Database - saving that all time progress
- Websockets - letting users communicate to the server and play together
