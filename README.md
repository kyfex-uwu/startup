# Meiket

Meiket is a place to create, share, and play in VR spaces. Built on the web so any VR device can access it, Meiket will revolutionize how people can share VR experiences.
It's a platform made with developers in mind, with built in tools to create both in and out of VR. And because it can be accessed through a web browser, you can share these experiences - both creating and playing - with anyone you want.

- HTML - login/profile/settings pages
- CSS - making a cohesive and clean style for the site
- JS - creating a code editor outside of VR, and rendering/interacting inside VR
- Authentication - letting users save their experiences under their account and have an identity inside VR
- Database - letting users save their user data (name, bio) and experiences
- Websockets - letting users play in the same space together
